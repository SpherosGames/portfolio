            they are going to do. They can either: pickup products or deliver
            materials. Either way, they will spawn when necessary. They will go to
            the designated company and execute their action. The owner is the
            first ai to work at the company. It takes out a loan and immediately
            orders some materials. The company then slowly converts the materials
            into usable products. When there are enough products, they get sold.
            The owner gets all the profits, but also needs to pay tax. The tax
            goes to the player. The owner must pay of their loan, pay their
            employees and rent. Employees also must pay their rent and pay taxes."

            have any impact on happiness, as there is no system for that yet. In the income panel you can see the
            total expenses and income. There is a bottom bar. In there you can change the name of the city, the
            current temperature, current balance and the amount of people that live in your city. Above that you can
            see a button for each of the placeable buildings. When you click on any vehicle you can see some
            information about it. For a car, you can see the passengers age, name and more. For a van, you can see
            its current cargo and what its going to do."
